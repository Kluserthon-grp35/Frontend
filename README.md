## Contributing Guide

### Step 1

Clone the project to your machine using ``git clone https://github.com/Kluserthon-grp35/Frontend.git``

### Step 2

Install all packages and dependencies by running ``yarn`` or ``yarn install``

NOTE: we are using ``yarn`` which is recommended, but you can as well use ``npm install``.

IMPORTANT: This project is using Node version 18.17.0 or greater, if you are facing error pertaining to this, simply install the node version from nodejs.org or if you have nvm on your machine, use ``nvm install 18.17.0``

## Step 3

Checkout to your own branch using ``git checkout -b yourname-fe`` e.g git checkout -b stephen-fe.

Don't make changes to the main branch directly, abeg.

### Step 3

Check the codebase and understand the structure before contributing

### Step 4

Once you understand how the project is structured, you can start writing code!

### Step 5

Commit and push to your branch, then send a Pull Request.

NOTE: If your PR has conflict, it will be rejected until you solve it. And please, don't force push.

The best way to avoid conflict is to always push from the main branch (``using git pull origin main``) before pushing your code.

Oh, commit messages are important too. Let it be descriptive enough. Below are examples:

If you fix the logo height, a commit message will be like ``FIX: I adjusted the logo``
Or if you add new feature, a commit message could look something like this: ``CHORE: Fetching all invoices is completed``
Or if you install new packages, you can say: ``INSTALL: I install axios package``.

Remember, always keep your commits clean and meaningful.

### Step 6:

Ask someone to review and merge your commit.









First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
